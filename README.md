# Claude Skills

Custom skills that extend Claude Code's functionality through structured workflows and integrations.

## What are Skills?

Skills are capabilities defined in markdown files that Claude Code can invoke to perform specialized tasks. Each skill contains:

- **Frontmatter metadata**: Name, description, version, license
- **Workflow instructions**: Step-by-step execution logic
- **Integration patterns**: MCP server tools, user interactions

## Available Skills

### make-note

**Version:** 1.1
**License:** MIT

Creates structured notes in Obsidian with intelligent tag suggestions based on existing vault patterns.

**Invocation:** Ask Claude to "create a note", "make a note", or "save content to Obsidian"

**Key Features:**
- Analyzes existing vault to identify common tag patterns
- Suggests 3-5 relevant tags based on note content
- Waits for user confirmation before creating note
- Creates notes in Resources folder with proper frontmatter
- Supports hierarchical tags (e.g., `ai/code-agent`, `dpg/strategy`)

**Workflow:**
1. Scans vault using `mcp-obsidian` server to get tag frequencies
2. Suggests relevant tags matching note content (3+ occurrences prioritized)
3. Presents options as numbered list for easy selection
4. Creates note with confirmed tags in Resources folder
5. Reports filepath and applied tags

**Output Format:**
```yaml
---
tags:
- tag1
- tag2
created: DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM
---
